# #100DaysOfCode Challenge

This repo has been built for me to show the code I have produced in the #100DaysOfCode challenge, it's for fun and shouldn't really be taken seriously by any professional programmers.

> If one is to learn, one must make mistakes and one must be able to make those mistakes with humility and an eagerness to continue to fail; hence success can be achieved.
